# Financial Performance Analysis

### Project Overview
The Financial Performance Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of a company’s financial health by tracking revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and working capital efficiency.  
It enables stakeholders to monitor monthly trends, compare performance against budgets, and evaluate product/service profitability across different regions and timeframes.

### Tools Used

- Excel – Data cleaning, transformation, and modeling  
- DAX – Custom measures for financial KPIs  
- Power Query – Data loading and shaping  

### Objective
To analyze and visualize the company’s financial performance over time, focusing on:
- Revenue growth trends  
- Gross profit and EBITDA margins  
- Budget vs actual performance  
- Cash flow movement  
- Product/service-wise revenue distribution  
- Receivables efficiency  

### Key KPIs
- Total Revenue
- Gross Margin %
- Net Cash
- EBITDA Percentage
- Revenue MoM%

### Dashboard Components

### Key Insights
- Revenue Growth: Steady month-over-month increase with December peaking due to strong product demand.  
- Profitability: Gross Margin (45.55%) indicates efficient cost control; EBITDA Margin (24.81%) shows room for operational optimization.
